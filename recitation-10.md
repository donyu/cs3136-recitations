## Templates and the Standard Template Library (STL) ##

### What's a template? ###
Function templates are special functions that can operate with generic types.

This allows us to create a function template whose functionality can be adapted to 
more than one type or class without repeating the entire code for each type.

### Sample function template: Merge Sort ###
Remember how we wrote mergesort for a char array in lab 1?  What if we could write it for ANY kind of array?
```c
template <typename T>
void merge_sort(T a[], int n)
{
  /* 
   * BASIS: if a has only 1 element, there is nothing to do.
   */
  if (n <= 1)
    return;
  
  
  /*
   * INDUCTION: merge_sort the 1st half and merge_sort the 2nd half
   * so that we have 2 half-size sorted arrays, and then merge them
   * into a single sorted array
   */
  int m = n / 2;
  
  /*
   * merge_sort the 1st m elements of a
   */
  merge_sort(a, m);
  
  /*
   * merge_sort the remaining n - m elements of the array "a + m",
   * which is a way to take a sub-array of "a" where a[m] is the new 
   * 0th element (i.e., (a+m)[0] is the same as a[m]).
   */
  merge_sort(a + m, n - m);

  /*
   * allocated a temporary array into which the merge function will
   * put the merged array.
   */
  T temp[n];

  /*
   * merge a (for which we are looking at only the 1st m elements)
   * and a+m (which has n-m elements from (a+m)[0] to (a+m)[n-m-1],
   *          which are really the same as a[m] to a[n-1])
   * into the temp array.
   */
  merge(a, m, a + m, n - m, temp);
  
  /*
   * copy the temp array back into a
   */
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    a[i] = temp[i];
}

template <typename T>
void merge(T a1[], int n1, T a2[], int n2, T output[])
{
  int i1 = 0;
  int i2 = 0;
  int j = 0;
  
  /*
   * go through the elements of a1 and a2,
   * copying the smaller one into the output array
   * until we reach the end of either a1 or a2.
   */
  while (i1 < n1 && i2 < n2) {
    /*
     * note that we take a1 if the two elements are the same.
     */
    if (a1[i1] <= a2[i2]) {
      output[j++] = a1[i1++];
    } else {
      output[j++] = a2[i2++];
    }
  }
  
  /*
   * copy over the remaining elements of a1, if any.
   */
  while (i1 < n1)
    output[j++] = a1[i1++];
  
  /*
   * copy over the remaining elements of a2, if any.
   */
  while (i2 < n2) 
    output[j++] = a2[i2++];
}
```

### Some things to remember with templates ###
```
  -Always need "template <typename T>" before function declaration/definition.
  -The function will only work with classes and types for which all functions/operators used in the function are defined.
```

### Difference between templates and void * ###
```
  Templates enable generic programming for all types while void * enables a typless programming.
  With templates, the programming is type-safe, so the compiler will catch type mismatches (things to remember #2).
  With void *, the programming is not type-safe, so seg-faults catch type mismatches :(.
  Templates enable value semantics, but with void * you are forced to use pointer semantics.
```

### STL Containers ###
The C++ Standard Template Library comes with built-in classes that contain data defined by templates.

These classes are based on different data structures and are called containers.

There are 3 different types of containers: sequence containers, container adapters, and associative containers.

We will focus on the 3 sequence containers: vector, deque, and list.

Good thing about these container fellas: they "contain" objects of type T "by value".  Don't have to do too much garbage collecting.  Elements of container are destroyed when container is destroyed.

### vector ###
```
  -an array
  -Provides efficient random access (operator[]) and adding/removing elements from the end of the vector (push_back()/pop_back()).
  -Supports item additions & removals at positions other than the end
    of the vector (insert()/remove()), but they are inefficient
    because other items need to be moved.
```
### deque ###
```
  - short for double-ended queue, pronounced "deck"
  - similar to vector, but unlike vector, deque supports efficient
    addition & removal of elements from the beginning of the deque
    (push_front()/pop_front()).
  - slower and/or wastes more memory than vector
```
### list ###
```
  - doubly linked list
  - efficient insertion & removal of elements anywhere in the list
  - no random access
```

### Iterators ###
  The sequential containers have iterators to keep track of elements.
```
  - "iterator" and "const_iterator" is a "type member" (i.e., a
    typedef defined inside a class)
  - An iterator behaves like a pointer: ++it, *it.  Sometimes it’s
    actully a pointer (vector<T>::iterator is just a typedef of T*),
    but more often it’s not.  (Think about what a list<T>::iterator
    would have to do when you increment it.)
  - Dereferencing an iterator gives you a T&, and dereferencing a
    const_iterator gives you a const T&.
  - v.begin() returns an iterator that points to the first element in
    the vector.
  - v.end() returns an iterator that points to ONE PAST THE LAST
    ELEMENT, not the last element.  It is used as a marker for the end
    of the container, and it cannot be dereferenced.
  - Note that we use "!=" rather than "<" in the for loop.  This is
    recommended (especially if you’re writing template code) because
    not all iterators define operator<().  (list iterator does not,
    for example.)
  - Note that we use ++it rather than it++.  This is recommended
    because when the iterator is a class object rather than a native
    pointer, it’s usually less costly to call ++it than it++.
```
